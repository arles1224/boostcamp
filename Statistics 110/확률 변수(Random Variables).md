# Random Variable
## What is random variable?
Random variable is a _function_ from the sample space. Think as numeric "summary" of an aspect of the event.

A function is deterministic. Then where is randomness coming from?
Randomness is coming from random experiment.
## Definition of Bernoulli Distribution
A random variable $X$ is said to have Bernoulli distribution.

If $X$ has only 2 possible values, 0 and 1, $P(X=1)=p, \ P(X=0) = 1-p$.
'$X = 1$' means an event that $X$ actually takes the value 1.

## Binomial (n, p) Distribution
The distribution of the number of succeses $X$ in $n$ independent Bern(p) trials is called Bin(n,p). 

$P(X=k)= _nC_k \ p^k{(1-p)}^{n-k}$($0 \leqq k \leqq n$): PMF(Probability Mass Function)
